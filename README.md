### What I learned

I'm happy because I learned a very nice feature in CSS. Thanks to this feature, we can tonally layer multiple colors in sequence from top to bottom or from right to left. You can see this feature in the background of the body or in the color transitions in the Score part on the right side of the application.

```css
body{
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, 
        hsl(0, 0%, 100%), 
        hsl(221, 100%, 96%), 
        hsl(241, 100%, 89%), 
        hsla(224, 30%, 27%, 0.1));
}
```

### Continued development

After this project, I will continue to learn JavaScript. I really want to make dynamic my codes with JS. So will enhance my Front-End knowledge with JS and so on. That's my goal üòÅ.
